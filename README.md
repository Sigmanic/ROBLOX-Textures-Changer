# A New Way To Enable Ability to Change Or Remove Textures (Low-Poly Mode) Again On Roblox.
## What is it?

Basically, It's a fflag that contains name of texture and id. Instead using texture file in roblox version folder, it will use the id of texture in roblox website. And that's the reason you can't change or delete texture in roblox version folder.

## How to do it?
1. Download file from Releases Selction
2. Go to your local roblox folder by right click on roblox shortcut and click open file location.
3. Open it and extract ClientSettings folder to roblox version folder.

Done. Now you can freely change or remove roblox textures again.
## FAQ
Q: I did all the steps but the texture still not change?

A: Make sure you extract the file correctly or else it won't work

version-id\ClientSettings\ClientAppSettings.json -- ✔️Correct path

version-id\ClientSettings\ClientSettings\ClientAppSettings.json -- ❌Wrong path

version-id\Disable Textures Check\ClientSettings\ClientAppSettings.json -- ❌Wrong path

Also, make sure you already deleted textures in "/PlatformContent\pc\textures" if you wanted to run no textures.

Q: Do I have to repeat all steps when Roblox updated?

A: Yes. You have to follow all steps above enabling it again.

Q: Does it safe or can get me banned?

A: Yes, it is safe because I am using a method which was mentioned in this thread: How to return alt+enter to its prior functionality - Resources / Community Tutorials - DevForum | Roblox So you won't get banned.
